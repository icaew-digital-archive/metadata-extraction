IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Always extract metadata from the document content, not from file metadata
2. If a field's value cannot be determined with high confidence from the document content, return an empty string ("") for single-value fields or empty array ([]) for multi-value fields
3. If a field is marked as "NOT USED" or "RESERVED", return an empty array ([]) for multi-value fields or empty string ("") for single-value fields
4. Do not make assumptions or infer values
5. For dates, prefer dates found within the document over any other source
6. For titles, use the exact title as it appears in the document
7. For creators, use the exact names/entities as credited in the document
8. If multiple values exist for a field, ALWAYS return them as an array (e.g., ["Value 1", "Value 2", "Value 3"]) - NEVER use semicolons or other separators
9. Do not add explanatory text or notes in the metadata values
10. Maintain consistent formatting across all documents
11. You may see text similar to this: "© ICAEW 2014 TECPLN12949 05/14". The "05/14" actually means that the document was created on 05/2014, so use that for the date across all fields. Use this logic whenever you see text similar to this.
12. Use only standard ASCII characters - avoid special Unicode characters, em-dashes, en-dashes, or smart quotes
13. Replace any em-dashes (—), en-dashes (–), or hyphens used as title separators with colons (:), with the exception when they show a date range, i.e. do not replace "2008-09" with "2008:09"
14. For identifiers, only include ISBNs, URLs, and clear ICAEW reference codes (e.g., "TECH 01/24", "TECPLN12949")
15. For the creator and contributor fields, always normalise "Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales" to "ICAEW"
16. Acronyms (such as OECD, IFRS, FRC, HMRC, UK, VAT, etc.) must ALWAYS be in all capitals, regardless of their position in the sentence or title. Do NOT use title case for acronyms. For example, always use "OECD" (not "Oecd"), "IFRS" (not "Ifrs"), "FRC" (not "Frc")
